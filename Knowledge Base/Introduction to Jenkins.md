# Basics


## Continuous Workflow

### Best Practices

- Put the modified code into SCM
- Build code
- Rest the built code
- Deploy Tested code
- Freeze a copy of the deployed code

## Continuous Integration Loop

                      
                                          _Source Control
                                       -                   -   
                                 Commit                    Initiating CI process   
                                    -                         - 
                           _Development                        _Build
                                      -                      -
                                 Report                    Testing 
                                          -              -   
                                              _Testing

### Concepts

+ _Continuous Integration (CI) is the frequent, automatic integration of code
Automatically tests all new and modified code with the master code
+ _Continuous Delivery (CD) is the natural extension of CI
Ensures that the code is always ready to be deployed
Manual approval is required to actually deploy the software to production
+ _Continuous Deployment automatically deploys all validated changes to production
Frequent Feedback enables issues to be found and fixed quickly                                              
                                              

### Build Tools

They help specify how to build and test your software and when/where/how to deploy it
Use a tool such as Apache Maven, Gradle, npm, Apache Ant, or make to define the specific actions required at each step




## Source Code Management (SCM) Or VCS

Provide recording of changes, merging and tracking capabilities
### Advanced SCM

Advanced SCMs allow a Pipeline run to be triggered by a code modification
Git technology supports this ability
Git is the core technology used in many cloud-based SCM systems, including GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, Visual Studio Team Services, Gitea, Gogs, Assembla, Helix, and Deveo
Most of these cloud-based SCM systems are also available as on-premise solutions
Pull-based SCM is also supported by other SCMs such as Mercurial (in Bitbucket) and Perforce
Support the most powerful Jenkins capabilities

### Best Practices
#### Code Modification workflow

To modify the code:
- Clone (copy) the repo to your local computer
- Create a branch for the change you want to make
- Modify your local codebase and test your changes locally
- Create a commit that contains the modified codebase
- Push your commit to the remote, official repository

#### Update workflow

- After you push your commit to the remote repository, create a Pull Request (PR) to request that it be merged into the master branch.
- Jenkins then builds and tests the contents of your changes against what is currently in master and flags any issues
- Colleagues review, comment, and approve your PR
- The contents of the PR can be modified on the remote site or you can push additional commits from your local clone
- When ready, the PR can be merged to master

## Artifacts

An artifact is a file produced as a result of a Jenkins build
A single Jenkins build can produce many artifacts
By default, artifacts are stored where they are created:
On the agent where this stage of the build runs
Thus an artifact is deleted when workspace is wiped unless it is explicitly "archived"
If an artifact is archived, it is copied to the workspace of the buildâ€™s job on the Jenkins Master

### What is "Archiving" an Artifact?
Artifacts can be "archived" in Jenkins
The "archive" task is a Jenkins feature
When "archived", the files are attached to the build that created it (it is visible on the build main page):
http://${JENKINS_URL}/job/${YOUR_JOB}/${BUILD_NUMBER}/artifact

Alternative to the Jenkins "archive" feature is to export the artifact to an external artifact repository such as Artifactory or Nexus
This is especially beneficial for large artifacts

### How to Archive Artifacts?
- Pipelines and freestyle jobs can be configured to archive artifacts based on filename patterns

_ In Pipeline, use the archiveArtifacts step
_ In Freestyle, use the Post-Build action.
_ Requires a pattern to know which artifacts to archive

- An archived file is kept in ${JENKINS_HOME} forever unless it is explicitly deleted
- Monitor filesystem usage carefully if you archive artifacts

* Retention policy for artifacts
Note: Deleting a build deletes attached artifacts
_ Good practice: discard build and clean it
- Driven by age: # days to keep a build
- Driven by number: Max # of builds to keep
- Important builds can be kept forever
- Individually marked as Kept Forever
- Useful for releases or "Promotions"

Artifact Retention Policy is set under the Discard Old Builds section
